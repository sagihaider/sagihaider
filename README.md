### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

About me

I am a Lecturer in Artificial Intelligence for Decision-Making at the School of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering in the University of Essex (UoE). Before joining on Lecturer position, I was a postdoctoral researcher fellow (IADS) at the UoE. I also worked at Swansea University as Postdoctoral Research Officer in Machine Learning. Before coming to the mainland, I spent approximately 4 years in Northern Ireland, UK where I completed my PhD under the supervision of Professor Girijesh Prasad and Dr Hubert Cecotti at the University of Ulster.
